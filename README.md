# Marvel Superheroes

I'm building this simple React Redux application as a way of learning and understanding how React and Redux work. As I'm a bit of a nerd I thought building something about superheroes is a fun way to learn these new cool skills.

The whole idea behind the whole app is to combine superhero comics and their related movie counterparts and fuse them together into a unique superhero encyclopedia application.

Think of it as combining a superhero IMDB with a superhero wikipedia.

In the initial phase I'll only be building a simplified version of a Marvel Superheroes website using the external Marvel API http://developer.marvel.com/

```bash
Please note

Marvel permits only 3000 API calls to the Marvel Comics API in a day.
```
The second phase will include the superhero IMDB.


## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
## Dependencies

```bash
React
Redux
ReactRedux
ReactRouter
ReduxThunk
ReactDom
```

## How it works

Through the use of Redux Thunk we return functions from the Action Creators which make API calls to retrieve data from Marvel's API.

```bash
Example:
